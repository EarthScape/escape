# escape

I've been thinking of maybe writing a fictional novel about mental health and native curses.  The preceding words you may have read were my trial wading into unknown depths, to see what, if anything, may be there.  It seems to me there may be some substance enough to warrant actually devoting time to this foray into new fields.  My perceptions are always difficult to put words to, mainly in that I tend to use heavier language in situations nobody else would bother ascribing much depth.  But everything I see is a real struggle, and sometimes my blacks are darker; sometimes my whites are blinding, but when I use most words, you have to judge by context my meaning or ultimately "ask me."  And the Indian running through brambles and muddy creeks stops for a moment to pick up a bright feather, to add it to the already brilliant, multivariate plumage in his streaming hair.  He runs by and I nod to him, knowing one day this land will return to itself and one day I will be vindicated for being vulnerable in public.

They move in the shadows, bringing change.

The anger existed before I set foot in this place.  The rage is boundless.  It pulses.  It wants to drown you, and it feasts on your unhappiness.  I see it there, waiting in the tangle of broken sticks and tattered plastic bags, pausing as you drive mindlessly by, judging whether or not your spirit is broken.  The anger of thousands of forgotten souls, the piercing shriek of a maelstrom of wounded dreams and shattered futures coalesced into a substrate of energy that lives behind every corner and every quavering bit of dew.  Insects chitter in response to the swelling.  I wait for it to stop trying to grab me.  I'm familiar with it enough to know it isn't trifling.  I've looked around me for someone to blame for its presence, its existence; there's nothing there.  But I feel that accursed darkness just as tangibly as you might feel a spider's web in the evening light.  It has substance and residue even as I doubt myself for calling into narration its existence.   And this is probably not the place nor the time to go about addressing ancient curses; the days of treading lightly are waning.  I just hope there is some measure of good to be received, even by persons outside my knowledge, given my risk in pursuing a dialog with treachery.

From the darkeness, a greener earth shall emerge.

As I lay there daydreaming of happier times, the invisible fingers of a dark entity wrapped themselves about my neck, choking out reason and restraint.  Images of desperation and sadness filled me, and an overwhelming urge to lash out overtook me.  I could feel that it was separate from me; I could feel it had a will of its own.  "This land is cursed," I thought to myself.  "Maybe it's the natives who cursed it."  It doesn't matter where it originated.  It permeates everything.  Does it know I know It's there?  Can it feel me pushing it away?  These things I think to myself, wondering if I should bother jotting them down.  "Will it make any difference?"  "Can I push back against the inexorable flow?"  There's a place I've driven by where the darkness seems stronger.  I see its arm reaching out from that place, fingers grasping for anyone vulnerable to it.  It doesn't care who it infests.  It's indiscriminate.  What is this evil?  It's the surrounding mists.

Choking and killing the life we once knew, yet there is hope.
